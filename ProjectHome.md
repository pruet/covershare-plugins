CoverShare.com is an online service providing cover art (mostly, for Thai artists). It provides an API to access the cover art collection. The project is to provide a set of plugins for music player, e.g., iTunes, Songbird, to access CoverShare's collection.

Developers are welcome, please contact me if you're interested in this project.

Current Version:
  * For iTunes: 0.1.0 ( Search CoverShare for Artwork.scpt )
  * For Songbird: 0.2.1 ( covershare.0.2.0.xpi )

If you like these plugins, please consider supporting CoverShare, e.g., click at the sponsor/advertisement  links on the web. Without service from CoverShare, these plugins are useless.

If you have CoverShare plugins for Songbird version 0.1.0, please uninstall it and install version 0.2.1 instead (covershare.0.2.1.xpi)
